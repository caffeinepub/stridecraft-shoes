  "summary": "Core frontend scaffolding (router layout with header/footer, themed Tailwind tokens, React Query hooks, contact form UI) and a Motoko backend actor with product/query/contact endpoints were added. However, backend persistence/seed requirements for the product catalog and contact submissions are not met based on the diff, and a couple of unrequested features/branding links were introduced.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Store products in stable state in the single Motoko main actor and seed the catalog with at least 6 sample products available after deployment.",
      "reason": "The backend defines `let products = Map.empty<ProductId, Product>();` with no `stable` storage and no seeding/initialization logic. As shown, the catalog will be empty after deployment and is not persisted in stable state.",
